I hooked the Dot up to my vintage Marantz Receiver through the tape input via a 3.5mm splitter to RCA patch cords: (I didn't use this, but some old RCA's and splitter I had hanging around--I might just buy this one, though!) https://www.amazon.com/KabelDirekt-Splitter-Auxiliary-Double-Shielded-supports/dp/B00DI89NPE/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1514054388&sr=8-8&keywords=3.5mm+splitter+rca ---Well, thought a little about it and ordered the KabelDirect splitter--good reviews and I assume it will improve the sound a bit.--- Anyway, it certainly isn't an audiophile arrangement, but it is very good and tonnes of fun to interface with requesting songs, artists, and genres. Highly recommended, but if you are in a dorm or apartment, I would read the review regarding security!!! Oh, I only have Dot playing through both speakers when I have the receiver set to \"mono\". With \"Stereo\" I lose one channel side--however, I don't see this as a problem. Now, I need to correct a mistake I made in my review. Dot has stereo output and plays with good separation through a two speaker stereo set up. My problem, when I previously wrote that it was a mono output was due to a poor splitter that had dropped a channel. So, please disregard that comment on mono output. I absolutely love being able to ask for a universe of music.",

Its like having my own personal assistant. And for that it's great. But I admit there are a few things that could use a improvement such as when u set a alarm. It works but there is about a ten seconds lag once the alarm goes off you can try and get Alexa to snooze. It may seem like it's not a big deal. But it drives me bonkers. Yes your able to get up and manually get it to stop but I'd rather just say Alexa snooze. But it appears to me there a delay. And another negative is Akinator when played questions get asked and you have minimal time to respond before the next question goes. It would be nice to have a little lag so you can think and answer. But for the price and what it does. It's worth the price and more. One recommendation is I would say buy a external speaker Bluetooth or aux or alternate speaker because the one on echo leaves much to be desired. If the improvement for snooze/cancel alarm I'd definitely give it 5 stars no question about it.",

On Android I couldn't get my Amazon apps section to open, but on my iPad I was able to go into my Amazon Music (to include my free Prime music) and select songs to play from there. Alexa will play songs from voice commands, but is not always intuitive to get it to play your specific songs that you want. The more specific you are the better it seems. They also really want you to sign up for Music Unlimited. My biggest reason for getting this was to attach it to a small set of Bose speakers in my bedroom that were collecting dust. I have the Dot plugged into my Bose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speakers with the Mini-Jack output from the Dot and the stereo RCA plugs into the Bose speaker pair. It added the convenience of playing music directly from the Echo Dot or through Bluetooth on my cellphone all wirelessly. This added amazing functionality to a \u201cdumb\u201d set of speakers. I believe you could attach the Dot to just about any speaker and turn it into a WiFi/Bluetooth streaming machine. Voice commands are surprisingly useful as well. I\u2019m very happy with this device and since I\u2019m an Amazon Prime subscriber it made sense to go the Amazon Echo Dot route as opposed to the Google Chromecast device that would have similar functionality. I usually purchase CD albums from Amazon and get the free MP3 version accessible through Amazon Music.",

Call her by the right name with love and affection and she responds nicely. LOL. I know there is so much more she can do and I'm looking forward to learning many more things.

It automatically connects to other amazon devices without me telling it to and starts controlling them. 3. It was great in the beginning but then it got really lazy with the commands and not doing what I was telling it to even when I would get on the app and give it feed back. The simple task of playing a playlist I have played several times before became something it couldn't handle and if it did play, it was ONLY one song on the playlist and then go into some really random CRAP songs that were never even close to anything I have ever played. This has been my mom common and frequent issue with these echo and echo dot devices. 4. The service is spotty as well and doesn't connect when I want it to. I have two of these in the same line of connection within the range for bluetooth and it still wont connect them.

It was very easy to set up and it works perfectly for him to turn on his lamps by voice. But that was just the beginning! I further made it easier for him to remember how to control the dot by using the app to change the command word to \"Computer\" (which seemed to resonate more naturally for Dad since he kept forgetting her ALEXA name LOL) I also named the outlets something he can easily relate \"Left Lamp\" and \"Right Lamp\" Another feature he uses regularly is the \"Computer. What time is it...\" because he often wakes up in the middle of the night and can't see clearly the clock across the room. Then I showed him how to play music, which he loves to play at night while going to sleep. At first, he complained it was too loud - that is until he learned to control the volume by voice. It's also set up to send me a message to my ECHO - a handy feature in cases he just wants to tell me something or have me call him later. The most fun I've had with introducing him to the DOT is the long list of things he can have fun doing using \"Easter Eggs\" (you can find on Google) and other informative content. He is amazed and has a new voice in his life that gives him a hand to live safer and more comfortably. Finally, beyond presenting him with a tool to make his life a little easier and a bit more entertaining - it's been proven that learning new skills is helpful for the elderly to retain mental agility... so there is that feature I think often over-looked.",

We followed up with a 1st gen Dot when they became available and set it up with a bluetooth speaker in our bedroom. The third we placed in our kitchen. The first Echo seems most responsive. It immediately answers questions and requests and the speaker is actually quite good. However, I think it might be location and placement. It sits on the counter and there are few ambient noises around. The second in our bedroom works fairly well. We probably use it the most. The speaker seems a little \"tinny\". We hooked it up to a small bluetooth speaker and it does well. My wife relocated it to the top of a display cabinet so Alexa struggles to hear there a bit. Our newest addition is the 2nd gen Dot and it was placed in the kitchen. We have been slower to adopt it to kitchen tasks only because it is habit to set timers and such in there manually. Adding items to the shopping list is really cool. If they can add a feature to allow multiple items at a time it would be great. We do use it a lot for music, internet radio and news etc. The kitchen Dot does struggle a little with ambient sound and I have moved it around the kitchen to get better responses. None of the Dots conflict with the other and setup for all were very easy. We have just started collecting Alexa enabled outlets and have started automating some lighting. We have a Wemo and now a handful of TP Link to experiment with. All fairly easy to install. I plan to purchase one more Dot for my garage workshop. I want to use it to automate some workshop and yard lighting as well as have hands free music etc available. We will see how the noise there affects it.",
